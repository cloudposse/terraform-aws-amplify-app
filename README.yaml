  Terraform module to provision AWS Amplify apps, backend environments, branches, domain associations, and webhooks. 

# How to use this module. Should be an easy example to copy and paste.
usage: |-
  For a complete example, see [examples/complete](examples/complete).

  For automated tests of the complete example using [bats](https://github.com/bats-core/bats-core) and [Terratest](https://github.com/gruntwork-io/terratest)
  (which tests and deploys the example on AWS), see [test](test).
