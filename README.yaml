  module "label" {
    source  = "cloudposse/label/null"
    # Cloud Posse recommends pinning every module to a specific version, though usually you want to use the current one
    # version = "x.x.x"

    namespace = "eg"
    name      = "example"
  }

  module "amplify_app" {
    source  = "cloudposse/amplify-app/aws"
